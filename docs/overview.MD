This project investigates the problem of predicting post-translational modification (PTM) sites in proteins using sequence-based deep learning methods. PTM site prediction is formulated as a residue-level classification task, where each amino acid in a protein sequence is evaluated for its likelihood of modification. The work begins with systematic dataset preparation, class imbalance analysis, and the establishment of strong baseline models to contextualize task difficulty. A protein-level evaluation protocol is adopted to prevent information leakage and ensure reliable performance estimates.

The core contribution of the project explores the use of the ProtMAMBA architecture, leveraging state-space modeling and gated sequence dynamics to capture long-range dependencies in protein sequences efficiently. The model is trained to generate contextualized residue representations and predict PTM probabilities at each sequence position. Performance is evaluated using metrics suited for imbalanced biological data, with emphasis on precision–recall behavior. Finally, qualitative and quantitative analyses are conducted to assess model robustness, error characteristics, and interpretability, providing insights into the applicability of MAMBA-based architectures for protein sequence modeling tasks.
